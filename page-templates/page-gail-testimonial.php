I'm not sure exactly what you are looking for in a testimonial but I have put some of my thoughts together and come up with this.
I may not have some of the terminology correct or put emphasis on specific areas of your expertise that you might think is needed, so please feel free to let me know where you would like any changes made or what you might want added.  Or, maybe you think it is too long so you would like to shorten it.  Whatever is fine with me, just let me know.  I could not remember the name of your company so if you want me to put that in places, just let me know.  
"When I was ready to start my pet care business, Maureen and I discussed the development of my website. She spent a lot of time with me and had obviously done her research in my field of business as she had a lot of pertinent information to share with me. She was extremely creative with thoughts, suggestions and ideas to use for content and for the layout and look of the website. You could tell she was experienced and had the knowledge to be able to do everything from start to finish - how to code and program everything needed, suggestions on who might host the site, what to do about getting a domain name, how to check for the originality of your business name, various sites where we could get pictures from, how to put all my script onto the site, etc. - I was very impressed!  She has continued to help me with further ideas for content or wording and always assists me to get my messages and information in the best manner to my clients.  Maureen maintains my website and, years later, still is an enormous help to me with continual new ideas and ways in which to improve the site. She is always open to constructive criticism and willing to make your website the exact way you envision it.  It was a huge task and time consuming undertaking to get a website up and running and I could not have done it without Maureen and her expertise!"
